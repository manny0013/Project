Because the number of column-titles is not the same as the number of columns, you will have to use <code>header = FALSE</code>. Also explicitely set the quote-character to the new quote-character as inserted in step 2:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>s3 &lt;- fread(\\\"sample3-1.txt\\\", quote = \\\"\\\\'\\\", header = FALSE, skip = 1)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>which gives:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt; s3\\n                         V1 V2 V3                   V4                                                        V5           V6
